## Who is this guide for?

This guide is for anyone that wants to learn to publish curriculum for Learn. It assumes that you are working on a Mac and are familiar with the Git and the command line.

## A new command-line based workflow

This `learn preview` command is part of a new curriculum creation flow that works like this:

1. Write/edit files.
2. Run `learn preview [path]` to preview.
3. When you are ready, Git Add/Commit/Push.
4. Run `learn publish` to publish to Learn for anyone to use.

## Next steps

There are two ways to learn how to use the CLI tools.
