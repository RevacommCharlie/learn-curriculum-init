# Challenges

Interactive questions called "challenges" can be added to any markdown lesson to check for understanding. These same challenges can also be used to construct practice assignments, exercises, and assessments.

## Types

* multiple choice (select one)
* checkbox (select multiple)
* short answer
* number
* paragraph
* code snippet--js, py, java, sql (code directly in Learn)
* project, testable project (code locally, submit a repo)

## Syntax

Syntax examples can be seen by looking at -- `01-example-unit/02-challenges.md`. The easiest way to write these is to use the snippets from https://github.com/gSchool/galvanize-flavored-markdown.
