# Assessments

Assessments can be constructed from the same challenges that you add to a lesson. Unlike a lesson, students taking an assessment can't try each answer until they find the right one. They submit the entire assessment at once for grading instead of checking each answer one at a time.

## Syntax

There is an assessment in the example unit that you can look at -- `01-example-unit/03-checkpoint.md`. Assessments are built in markdown in the same way that lessons are, but they use a naming convention like `99-checkpoint.md` for the autoconfig to find them.

## Demo

Try out a working example in Learn. The challenges will act like a lesson with this command, but you can test the questions out this way--

```
learn preview -o 01-example-unit/03-checkpoint.md
```

Preview the entire unit to see the questions as an assessment. (You will need to open the unit and navigate to the Assessment Example). You won't be able to submit because you aren't signed in as a student.

```
learn preview -o .
```
