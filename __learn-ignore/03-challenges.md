# Challenges

Interactive questions called "challenges" can be added to any markdown lesson to check for understanding. These same challenges can also be used to construct practice assignments, quizzes, and assessments.

## Types

* multiple choice (select one)
* checkbox (select multiple)
* short answer
* number
* paragraph
* code snippet (javascript, python, java, sql, custom)
* project (and testable project)

## Syntax

Syntax examples can be seen by opening this file in your editor -- `01-example-unit/challenges.md`. The easiest way to write these is to use the snippets from https://github.com/gSchool/galvanize-flavored-markdown.
